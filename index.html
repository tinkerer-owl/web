            <p>Hello, I'm Rahul, and I'm a Maker. Engaged in the alternative learning movement, I facilitate tinkerers and makerspaces. The creation of tangible objects involves a significant investment of material and energy, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable practices. With a profound commitment to sustainability, I recognize that distancing ourselves from the earth can lead to a more mechanized existence rather than one rooted in compassion. The choices we make in our creative pursuits today hold the power to shape the future profoundly. As we delve into exploring new materials and technologies, it's crucial not to overlook the emerging challenges they bring. My studies and research are focused on these critical areas, all while finding joy in tinkering.</p>
